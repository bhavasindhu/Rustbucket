New Sequence Addition (Scene 1 Ending)
Scene: Optic Upgrade + Perception Shift

    After the fight with Spark-E and the bonding moment with Cleatus...

    Cleatus installs an old, dusty ocular unit into RB’s head cavity.

    RB’s “vision” recalibrates:

        Pixel grid warps

        CRT border shakes, glitches

        Backgrounds blur

        UI tears then fades

    New UI fades in:

        Sleek semi-3D HUD

        Scanlines removed

        Text becomes sharper

    Camera pans to show the same junkyard — but with deeper lighting, higher res detail, and parallax.

    End scene with temporary control in new mode — or fade to title screen.
