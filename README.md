# Rustbucket

This is my video game app. 
It was first concieved by my nephew, Gabe Metzger, and I. 
Some of the conceptual art has already been completed, 
but it still has a ways to go. 

I'm just focusing my initial goal on importing the conceptual art, which translates into video figures and play screens. 
Once I have that over, I'll invite Gabe to make contributions. He's suggested that he has a few simple products to share. 

A word on the style of the game: this is not intended to be a hi-rez, cutting-edge game. It is, rather, intended to have a simple style, something reflecting first NES generation games or very close to that, perhaps Sega; so, 8-bit or 16-bit color graphics, sounds, and resolutions. The game play is all in the customizability of the robot. One has to find various parts from the junkyard, some of which will come from bosses (as with Megaman), but some which will be random finds, hidden in the junk heaps. The robot is highly limited at first. As such, the first level may reflect a very limited challenge. More or less, just jumping, no shooting ability, avoiding basic enemies. 

This brings up the question of enemies. I've come up with a number of bosses, but each level needs to be made to reflect that bosses' style, and this is something I've given almost no attention to previously. 

The story line still needs some work. Rustbucket is in a junkyard, meets with minimal resistance until he meets Cleatus and Rufus, who initially fight him, only to befriend him for surviving a minute or so. They install some basic tech, and the abilities upgrade, difficulty increases, new enemies, new boss. 

The larger story has him meeting an AI in the factory of his production. Not sure how best to deal with that. 

The tech additions reflect themes, which change each level. 

something along the lines of ten levels is desireable. 

Gabe disagrees with me on the question of Alien tech. He feels it would be too much power. But compromised on it in the sense of a cheat code that unlocks the alien tech level.
