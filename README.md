# Rustbucket

**Rustbucket** is my first directorial role in the development of a video game app.  
The project was originally conceived by my nephew, Gabe Metzger, and myself during my final year of graduate school.

## Project Status

- Currently in MVP development phase
- First target platform: **Steam**
- Engine: **Unity 2022.3.2f1 LTS**
- Art: **Custom pixel-based and AI-augmented**
- Code: In progress, starting with junkyard intro level

---

## Concept & Style

The game is set in a **broken-down junkyard world**, with a rusty, semi-retro aesthetic.  
Originally inspired by 8-bit and 16-bit NES/Sega-era graphics, the style has since evolved to support a broader gameplay and educational experience.

---

## Gameplay Goals

- Recover junkyard parts to gradually rebuild and customize RB (Rustbucket)
- Combat and exploration focused, with occasional engineering-based puzzles
- Modular boss design: each boss yields new functional parts (à la *MegaMan*)
- Early game (MVP): No weapons — just movement and evasion
- Boss and minion design reflects narrative and environment logic

---

## Educational Angle

- Promotes **STEM learning** through mechanical upgrades, repair mechanics, and in-game STEM codex. 
- Encourages players to problem-solve using real-world engineering constraints
- LLM-driven A.I. NPCs may later be included for rich interaction and improvisation

---

## Game Modes

- **Easy Mode**: For ages 8–11
- **Normal Mode**: Ages 12–15
- **Hardcore Mode**: Ages 16+, includes alien technology arc

Alien tech is only accessible in Hardcore Mode to maintain narrative integrity and balance.

## Narrative Overview

Rustbucket awakens as a broken remnant of a once-powerful entity.  
Found by Spark-E Rufus and Cleatus in a scrap heap, he survives a hostile encounter and earns their respect.  
Cleatus begins restoring him, initiating a long quest through a world of malfunctioning A.I., forgotten relics, and strange technologies.

## Story of the Story

A lot of conceptual art has already been completed, but it still has a ways to go. I made a lot of the art on my own, but the project stalled, due to other projects and commitments. When I finally conceded that it would take forever to complete, given all of my other responsibilities and projects, I began using AI to assist in the build. This has accelerated the pipeline significantly, but I would ultimately like to bring on other creators who understand and appreciate the vision, to help see this to completion. At the moment, I'm aiming at a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for release on the Steam platform, and aim to build out the more complete game and to other platforms from there. 

A word on the style of the game: the game-aesthetic is intended to be simple, with a rusty, broken-down feel, as it takes place in a junkyard. I initially conceived it as something reflecting the style of first generation NES games or very close to that, perhaps Sega; so, 8-bit or 16-bit color graphics, sounds, and resolutions; but as I expanded my ambitions for what the game would provide in terms of gameplay and educational value, the aesthetic evolved; the game play centers on the customizability of the robot, and the practical engineering principles applied. The player has to recover various components from the junkyard, some of which will come from bosses (similar in this respect to "Megaman"), but some which will be random finds, hidden in the junk heaps. The robot is highly limited at first. As such, the first level (MVP) may reflect a very limited challenge. More or less, just jumping, no shooting ability, avoiding minions, rather than defeating them. The game is intended to promote STEM education, while simultaneously affording players an enjoyable, immersive world with rich narrative arcs. 

This raises the question of enemies. We've come up with a number of bosses, and developed level aesthetics to complement the boss characters' narrative arc. We still have a lot of work to do with "minions", having developed some of these in only a few of the existing levels. We are also working out a pacifist arc, among ways to complete the game.

The story line has been developed a decent amount as of May 2025, with more developments in the pipeline. Rustbucket awakens as a broken, partial remnant of his former embodiment in a junkyard, where he first encounters Spark-E Rufus and Cleatus, who initially instigate a short fight, only to befriend him for merely surviving a minute or so. They install some basic tech, and the abilities upgrade, difficulty increases, new enemies, new boss. There are various A.I. NPCs, some of which may use LLMs to feed gameplay. 

Currently, something along the lines of ten levels is desireable, though other levels or DLMs may expand the world and narrative arc further. 

Gabe and I discussed whether Alien Tech would be ultimately cheating, so I have resolved to only allow it in hardcore mode, where the game is invariably more difficult. The game will have 3 modes, aimed at three age-groups from 8-18 (or so).
